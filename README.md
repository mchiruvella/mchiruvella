### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Manoj, test automation enthusiast & speaker. I am hands-on guy with managerial experience & would love explore new open-source technologies & tools for QA. I have experience in tesing monolith applications, transistioning monolith to microservices & scalable microservices architecture applications. Built test ecosystems  with test automation framworks, execution tools, monitoring & tracebility dashboards.


- **I'm most excited** about: [hawqai](https://github.com/mchiruvella/hawqai) - a QA portal to initiate, monitor & visualize test automation executions. It provides an overall insights on daily executions & build trends on test automation failures.
